## Welcome to try our new software [MSIsensor-RNA](https://github.com/xjtu-omics/msisensor-rna) for MSI detection with RNA-seq data!


# Introduction of MSIsensor-pro
MSIsensor-pro is an updated version of **[msisensor](https://github.com/ding-lab/msisensor)**.
MSIsensor-pro evaluates Microsatellite Instability (MSI) for cancer patients with next generation sequencing
data. It accepts the whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing and target region (panel)
sequencing data as input.  MSIsensor-pro introduces a multinomial distribution model
to quantify polymerase slippages for each tumor sample and a discriminative sites selection
method to enable MSI detection without matched normal samples. For samples of various
sequencing depths and tumor purities, MSIsensor-pro significantly outperformed
the current leading methods which required matched normal samples in terms of both accuracy
and computational cost. If you want to know more detail about MSIsensor-pro, please see
our research paper at [_**Genomics, Proteomics & Bioinformatics**_](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672022920300218) page.
